# freecodecamp-python-projects
This is my first Python project from freeCodeCamp.org, where I learned the fundamentals of variables, strings, and loops by creating a Caesar Cipher.

The cipher shifts each letter in the alphabet 3 positions forward, wrapping around at the end (so "z" becomes "c").

This project helped me practice:
Declaring and assigning variables
using string methods (.find(), .lower()
Looping through characters in a string
Building new strings step by step
Using the modulus operator % to loop through the alphabet
